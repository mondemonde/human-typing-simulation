<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Instead of directly copying the contents in a flash, this program is intended to type each character which simulates human like typing event. 

Here's why:

* Made by a student for fellow students , this can be used to present screen of typing homework live on screen from clipboard without user interference
* Manual labor can be reduced.


A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.
