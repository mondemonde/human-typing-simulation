<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Instead of directly copying the contents in a flash, this program is intended to type each character which simulates human like typing event. 

Here's why:

* Made by a student for fellow students, this can be used to present screen of typing homework live on screen from clipboard without user interference
* Manual labor can be reduced.


A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## --IMPORTANT--:

**Warning: You cannot change window while the simulator is running, If you do so the upcoming keys combination from your clipboard might be lethal and crash your system in worst case scenario. STOP THE SIMUATION OR LET IT BE COMPLETED**

## Usage

1. Run the main.py in terminal
2. Estimate time you need before the simulator starts typing which should include:
   * Time required changing the window to the editor you want to use
   *   Placing the cursor at starting position where you want to start the simulator to type in 

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

`26-11-20`: Added timer function for delaying the start of simulator

`{upcoming}`: Add a personalized "key phrase" combination to interrupt the simulator

`{upcoming}`: Pause and play in simulation

`{upcoming}`: Pack it into an EXE file for people not knowing how to use python or terminal

`{upcoming}`: Final update for interactive application with latest UI
