<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About the Project

<!-- [![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com) -->

Instead of directly copying the contents in a flash, this program is intended to type each character which simulates human like typing event. 

Here's why:

* Made by a student for fellow students , this can be used to present screen of typing homework live on screen from clipboard without user interference
* Manual labor can be reduced.


A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

Here is list of MAJOR dependencies for this project (for running this you will need a few more too; and how to install them is shown further below)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

List of things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* pyautogui
* pyperclip
* time


### Installation

* pyautogui
```sh
pip install pyautogui --user
```
* pyperclip
```sh
pip install matplotlib --user
```
* time
```sh
pip install time --user
```

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## --IMPORTANT--:

**Warning: You cannot change window while the simulator is running, If you do so the upcoming keys combination from your clipboard might be leathal and crash youlethalm in worst case scenario. STOP THE SIMUATION OR LET IT BE COMPLETED**

## Usage

1. Run the main.py in terminal
2. Estimate time you need before the simulator starts typing which should include:
   * Time required changing the window to the editor you want to use
   *   Placing the cursor at starting position where you want to start the simulator to type in 

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

26-11-20: Added timer function for delaying the start of simulator

{upcoming}: Add a personalized keyphrase combination to interrupt the simulator

{upcoming}: Pause and play in simulation

{upcoming}: Pack it into an EXE file for people not knowing how to use python or terminal

{upcoming}: Final update for interactive application with latest UI
